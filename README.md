The online library website is a project that I have developed using Bootstrap, SQL, and PHP. The website provides users with a convenient and efficient way to access a wide range of books and other reading materials online.

One of the key features of this website is its integration with a fingerprint attendance system. This system ensures that only registered users can access the library's resources, providing an extra layer of security for the library's content.

The website's user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to easily search for and access the materials they need. The search functionality allows users to search for books by author, title, or keyword, while the user dashboard provides easy access to the user's borrowing history and other account information.

The website's backend is powered by SQL and PHP, which provides a robust and reliable foundation for managing the library's resources and user data. The system is scalable and can be easily customized to fit the specific needs of different libraries and user communities.

Overall, the online library website is a reliable and efficient solution for managing and accessing library resources online. Its integration with a fingerprint attendance system adds an extra layer of security and ensures that only registered users can access the library's content. With its intuitive user interface and scalable backend, this website is an ideal solution for libraries looking to provide convenient and efficient access to their resources online.
